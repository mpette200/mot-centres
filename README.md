## Postcode and MOT Test Centres

In UK cars and vehicles need to be tested at authorized MOT test centres. Government publishes a list of active MOT test stations. Locations can be determined by postcode.

There are around 1.7 million postcodes in Britain, and around 23,000 MOT test stations. The challenge is to lookup the closest MOT test stations in a performant way without using any kind of database, ie. just using plain javascript. Hopefully this site will show that this is possible with a bit of careful preparation.
